# Dhaba- A Discord bot

The project is a bot for discord servers. Its built using
discord.py package and has all the functionality a discord
bot must have plus some special features I made for the servers.

I used a lot of old and new programming packages in this project.
I also learnt a lot of new programming features.

Some of these include:
- Asynchronous programming
- Web Scrapping
- Files (creation, reading etc)
- Decorators in python
- Error handeling 
- and a lot more...


## Roadmap

- Add song playing functionality

- Add roles and level up server members

- Give bot sort of a personality through the commands 
    and events


  
## Deployment

To deploy this project you need python 3.7 or above
and need discord.py installed.

```bash
  pip install discord.py
```

After installation head over to discord developer page
and register an app.
